# zambia_hmlp (ongoing project)

Increasing Gender equality in higher education is a priority for the Zambian government. Through this project, the public and private universities in Zambia were mapped. First, the latitude and longitude of universities was geocoded using geopandas. It was then mapped using geopandas and folium.

Indeed, below we can see that the number of places for female students in public Universities is higher in the places where the ratio of female working population is highest (Lusaka and Copperbelt).

Indeed, the number of universities places maps to population density, as can be seen below. However, it does not map to the areas that are currently growing, suggesting that new universities may be needed to meet the demands of a growing population. Still, it should be noted that the Zambian government is currently building universities, including Paul Mushindo University in Muchinga Province, King Lewanika University at Namushakende in Western Province and Luapula University in Mansa, as well as Robert Kapasa Makasa University in Chinsali.
